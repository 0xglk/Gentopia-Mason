INFO:root:It seems like you're trying to specify a version of the python-dotenv package. However, as a scholar AI, I'm designed to interact with Google Scholar APIs for searching authors and papers, and to do literature reviews for a specific domain. I can help you find research papers or authors related to python-dotenv or any other topic. Could you please provide more context or clarify your request?
